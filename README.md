# Community Bridge Portal

## Project Overview
The Community Bridge Portal is an innovative platform designed to empower citizens to report civic issues and collaborate on solutions. It enhances community engagement and allows individuals to make a real difference within their neighborhoods by promoting transparency and interaction with local authorities.

## Installation
To set up the Community Bridge Portal on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/community-bridge-portal.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd community-bridge-portal
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Node.js (version >= 14.15.0) and npm installed. Run the following command to install the necessary packages:
